#Country Exploratory Data Analysis

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on a dataset of 239 countries, including information such as population, surface area, life expectancy, GNP, government form, and more.

The goal is to visualize and analyze global patterns in demographics, economy, and geography using Python.
