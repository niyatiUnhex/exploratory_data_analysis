# 🌍 Country Exploratory Data Analysis  

This repository contains an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project on a dataset of **239 countries**, including information such as population, surface area, life expectancy, GNP, government form, and more.  

The goal is to **visualize and analyze global patterns** in demographics, economy, and geography using Python.

## 🔍 Exploratory Analysis
The notebook includes:  
- **Distributions** of population, life expectancy, and GNP  
- **Boxplots** comparing variables across continents and regions  
- **Scatterplots** showing relationships (e.g., GNP vs Life Expectancy)  
- **Heatmaps** of correlations among numerical features  
- **Top-N analysis** (most populated countries, etc.)  

📌 Dependencies
